        <p class="mb-4 hover:text-blue-400 transition duration-300">
          I come from a close-knit family that includes my supportive parents, Lhawang Dema and Karma Phuntsho, and my sister, Nima Paldon, who inspires me every day with her creativity and determination. We share a lot of laughter and meaningful conversations, and I cherish the time we spend together, whether it’s enjoying family dinners or exploring new places. Their encouragement has played a significant role in my journey, motivating me to pursue my passions and always strive for the best.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4 hover:text-blue-400 transition duration-300">
          I have a strong passion for coding, particularly in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My journey as a coder has been incredibly rewarding, and I love the challenge of turning ideas into functional and beautiful applications.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4 hover:text-blue-400 transition duration-300">
          Python is one of my favorite languages to work with. I enjoy using it for a variety of projects, from data analysis to web development. Whether I’m automating tasks or building applications with frameworks like Flask or Django, I appreciate Python’s versatility and readability.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4 hover:text-blue-400 transition duration-300">
          When it comes to HTML and CSS, I take pride in creating visually appealing and responsive web pages. I understand the importance of design and user experience, and I strive to ensure that my projects not only look great but also function seamlessly across all devices. JavaScript is where I really enjoy adding interactivity to my work. I love experimenting with dynamic features and animations that enhance user engagement. Keeping up with the latest frameworks and libraries is something I’m passionate about, as it helps me stay on the cutting edge of web development.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4 hover:text--400 transition duration-300">
          Beyond my technical skills, I value collaboration and problem-solving. I thrive in team environments and enjoy brainstorming solutions with others. I’m always eager to learn and explore new technologies, which drives my growth as a developer.
