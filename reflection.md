## Documentation
### Main Concepts Applied:
Working on this project gave me a chance to dive deep into object-oriented programming. I focused on setting up classes, creating methods to get things done efficiently, and using encapsulation to keep things organized. I also picked up some new tricks for handling errors, which really helped make the program more user friendly.

### New Skills/Knowledge Acquired:
One of the biggest takeaways was learning how to structure code in a way that’s practical and easy to expand on. I also got better at anticipating where things might go wrong, which meant my code was more resilient and ready for anything that the user might throw at it.

### What I Learned:
Beyond just coding, I learned a lot about problem-solving. Writing code that works is one thing, but making it work well and be reliable is a whole other challenge. This project pushed me to think about the user experience, and it was rewarding to see how well-thought design makes a difference.

### Challenges and Solutions:
One challenge I ran into was handling unexpected inputs from users. Some types of input would break the program at first, so I added error handling to catch and manage these situations better. I also faced some bugs when managing data flow between classes. After troubleshooting (screenshot included), I figured out a solution that kept things running smooth.
