                    During my time at the Changjiji Youth Center, I had the incredible opportunity
                    to immerse myself in the community and make a meaningful impact. The center
                    serves as a safe haven for local youth, providing various programs aimed at
                    fostering personal growth and development.

                    As a volunteer, I engaged in several activities tailored to the needs of the
                    young people at the center. I helped organize workshops focused on life skills,
                    such as resume writing, interview preparation, and financial literacy. It was
                    rewarding to see participants gain confidence as they learned to present
                    themselves effectively and plan for their futures.

                    In addition to my work at Changjiji, I was actively involved in the AFHs (After-
                    School Homework Support) program. This initiative aimed to provide academic
                    assistance to students struggling with their studies. I facilitated group study
                    sessions and one-on-one tutoring, helping students tackle challenging subjects
                    and complete their homework. The joy on their faces when they grasped a difficult
                    concept was truly priceless and motivated me to keep supporting them.

                    Moreover, I participated in Winter Engagement Programs, where we organized
                    seasonal activities to keep the youth active and engaged during the colder
                    months. These programs included arts and crafts, sports, and community
                    service projects. I led a group of volunteers in creating a winter carnival,
                    which featured games, food, and entertainment. It was heartwarming to see
                    the kids come together, share laughs, and enjoy the festivities, creating
                    lasting memories.

                    Volunteering at Changjiji Youth Center and participating in these programs
                    taught me the importance of community, empathy, and resilience. I came away
                    not only with new skills and experiences but also with a deeper understanding
                    of the challenges faced by the youth in our community. Overall, this
                    experience solidified my commitment to giving back and supporting those in
                    need.
